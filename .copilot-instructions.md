# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview
This is a VitePress app (running on v2 which is currently in Alpha) that serves as a brand center for Koncerto and its sub-brands. The app provides guidelines, assets, and resources for maintaining brand consistency across various platforms and media.

## Coding Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use Vue 3 with <script setup> syntax for custom components
- Prefer composition API and composables for shared logic
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Use the latest stable Tailwind CSS for style declarations

## Architecture Guidelines
- Adhere to VitePress v2 structure
- Place custom Vue components in `.vitepress/components`
- Use Markdown for documentation, Vue for interactive or dynamic content
- Keep components small and focused
- Use VitePress composables (e.g., `useData`) for site/page/theme data
- Customize theme via `.vitepress/theme`
- Implement proper error boundaries in Vue components

## File Organization
- Markdown content in project root or docs folder
- Custom Vue components in `.vitepress/components`
- Theme customization in `.vitepress/theme`
- Utilities in `/utils`
- Types in `/types`

## Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all utilities
- Test Vue components with Vitest or Vue Test Utils
- Aim for 80%+ code coverage

## Specific Preferences
- Use const assertions for literal types
- Prefer async/await over .then()
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use Markdown frontmatter for page configuration

## Brand Center Specific
- Follow brand guidelines for UI components
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Use design tokens for consistent styling
- Use the latest stable Tailwind CSS for all style declarations
